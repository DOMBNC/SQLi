# SQLi(SQL injection)

#### What Is SQLi (SQL injection)?

SQL injection is a web security vulnerability. In some cases, it allows an attacker to access the database system, so the attacker can delete or change database data that the attacker should not be allowed to do. or in other cases, the attacker can receive the user's information. In short, SQLi is a vulnerability created by a negligent creator, allowing ordinary users to exploit it and causing serious consequences in the database system.
#### SQLi types
SQL injection has 3 main types:
* In-band SQLi
* Inferential SQLi (Blind SQLi)
* Out-of-band SQLi

In-band SQLi is the most common form of attack and is also the easiest to exploit SQL Injection vulnerabilities

#### Impact of SQLi (SQL injection)

As a result, attackers can take advantage of this vulnerability to retrieve users' data such as:
* User account and password.
* personal data.
* In addition, it also can directly affect the database.

#### How to detect web SQL injection vulnerabilities?

You can use systematic tests on the application or website entry points to detect web SQL injection vulnerabilities. Here are some common ways to detect:
* You can use the single quote character ' and look at the error message to identify it.
* You can use boolean conditional statements such as OR 1=1, 2=2, 'a' = 'a', 3>2 and so on. Then look at the response results of the app/website to identify.
* you can use sleep(time) statement and see the response delay time of the application/website.
* you can also use the scan on Burp Suite tool to detect SQLi.
#### How to prevent SQL injection 
Here are some ways to prevent SQL vulnerabilities:
* Filtering data from users: This prevention method is similar to XSS. We use filter to filter special characters (; ‚Äù ') or keywords (SELECT, UNION) entered by the user.
* Do not add strings to create SQL: Use parameters instead of adding strings. If the data transmitted is not legal, SQL Engine will automatically report an error, we do not need to use code to check.
* Does not display exception or error message: Hackers rely on error messages to find out the database structure. When there is an error, we only display the error message, not the full information about the error, to prevent hackers from taking advantage.
* Clear permissions in the DB: If you only access data from some tables, create an account in the DB, assign access rights to that account, and do not use the root account. At this time, even if hackers successfully perform SQL injection, they will not be able to read data from the main tables and edit or delete data.
* Back up data regularly: Data must be regularly backed up so that if it is deleted by a hacker, we can still restore it.
* Use a firewall: you can use a firewall to analyze data entered by users into the app or website.
